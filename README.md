# Hi there, I'm Justin! Welcome to my GitHub.

## 👨🏻‍💻 About Me 

I am a Full Stack Developer with certifications from the City University of New York and experience building scalable web applications. My expertise spans front-end and back-end development, with proficiency in technologies such as HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express, Django, Python, Flask, FastAPI, and SQL, among others. 
<br><br>
I like working with React to develop user-friendly interfaces with interactive designs. I also enjoy collaborating with others to solve complex problems and deliver thoughtful solutions.

## ⌨️ Current Project 

### [Silbiger Family Tree 🌲](https://github.com/JustinSilbiger/silbiger)

I am currently leading the development of the **Silbiger Family Tree Database**, a comprehensive web application designed to document and expand upon the genealogy of the Silbiger family. The platform manages a growing list of over 1200 family members, featuring an intuitive user interface for exploring family connections. This project preserves and enhances data from the legacy Silbiger Family Website, addressing its limitations by leveraging **Node.js** and **Express** for the backend and **PostgreSQL** for efficient data management.

#### Key Features:
- User authentication and secure access
- Comprehensive data management
- Intuitive, user-friendly interface for exploring family history

This project aims to make it easier for users to learn about their ancestry, trace their roots, and connect with relatives.

*If you are a Silbiger and would like to join the family tree, please submit the form on the website to get in touch with me.*
<br>
*Please note that the application is deployed on Render's free tier, so the instance may take a moment to spin up after periods of inactivity.*
